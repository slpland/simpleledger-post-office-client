# Welcome to Badger!

If you're submitting code to Badger, there are some simple things we'd appreciate you doing to help us stay organized!

First check out the [Issues page on Github](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/badger/issues) to see if there are any open issues which seem like something you could solve. Next join our [discord server](http://geni.us/CashDev) to chat w/ the team in real-time.

### Finding the right project

Before taking the time to code and implement something, feel free to open an issue and discuss it! There may even be an issue already open, and together we may come up with a specific strategy before you take your precious time to write code.

There are also plenty of open issues we'd love help with. Search the [`good first issue`](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/badger/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label.

### Submitting a pull request

When you're done with your project / bugfix / feature and ready to submit a PR, there are a couple guidelines we ask you to follow:

- [ ] **Test it**: For any new programmatic functionality, we like unit tests when possible, so if you can keep your code cleanly isolated, please do add a test file to the `tests` folder.
- [ ] **Add to the CHANGELOG**: Help us keep track of all the moving pieces by adding an entry to the [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/badger/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md) with a link to your PR.
- [ ] **Meet the spec**: Make sure the PR adds functionality that matches the issue you're closing. This is especially important for bounties: sometimes design or implementation details are included in the conversation, so read carefully!
- [ ] **Close the issue**: If this PR closes an open issue, add the line `Fixes #$ISSUE_NUMBER`. Ex. For closing issue 418, include the line `Fixes #418`. If it doesn't close the issue but addresses it partially, just include a reference to the issue number, like `#418`.
- [ ] **Keep it simple**: Try not to include multiple features in a single PR, and don't make extraneous changes outside the scope of your contribution. All those touched files make things harder to review ;)
- [ ] **PR against `develop`**: Submit your PR against the `develop` branch.
- [ ] **Get reviewed by a core contributor**: Make sure you get a `:thumbsup`, `:+1`, or `LGTM` from a user with a `Member` badge before merging.

And that's it! Thanks for helping out.
